# VS Code
- VS Code is a very powerful editor with countless great features and 3rd party extensions to do basically anything
- VS Code is a super powerful code editor.
- The editor is open source, and there’s no payment required to use it.
- It’s fast. And very flexible, it adapts to your way of working. And I’ll show you how to customize it to suit any kind of programming activity, even writing (I’m writing this article in VS Code)

## 	The interface
- When you start the editor for the first time you will see the welcome screen:

- There is a bar on the left, called Activity Bar, with 5 icons.
- That gives access to:
  - The Explorer
  - Search
  - Source Control
  - Run and Debug
  - The Extensions
- One important thing this introduces is the command palette, which lists a few useful commands, which you open by pressing the keyboard shortcut cmd/ctrl+shift+p, or from the menu View -> Command palette:

## Opening folders
- From the welcome screen, you can open a folder on your computer by clicking the Open... link

- Usually you don’t have this “welcome” screen enabled, and you use the menu File -> Open folder....
- This opens the folder in a new window, for example here I opened an empty testing folder:
![ERROR](https://thevalleyofcode.com/images/lessons/vscode/Screenshot-2023-10-09T10.00.51AM.png)
- If that folder contained files, you’d see them in the Explorer sidebar.
